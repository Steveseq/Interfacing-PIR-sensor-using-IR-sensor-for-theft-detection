# Interfacing-PIR-sensor-using-IR-sensor-for-theft-detection
I created an IOT based theft detection system using Arduino Uno, IR sensor, Arduino IDE and PIR Motion Sensor. For monitoring changes in infrared radiation, When motion is detected, the PIR sensor sends out a signal in the serial monitor of Arduino IDE that motion is detected.
